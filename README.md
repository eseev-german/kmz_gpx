# Export a Route from Google My Maps as a KMZ File

## 1. Open Google My Maps
- Go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps).
- Sign in with your Google account if you aren't already logged in.

## 2. Create a New Map
- Click on **"Create a new map"**.
- A new map will open, and you'll see options to customize it.

## 3. Build Your Route
- In the toolbar below the search bar, click on the **"Add directions"** icon (a curved arrow).
- This will create a new "Directions" layer in the map's legend on the left side.
- Enter your **starting point** and **destination** in the fields provided.
- Google My Maps will automatically generate a route. You can add more stops by clicking **"Add destination"** and entering additional waypoints.

## 4. Save the Route
- The route is automatically saved to your Google account as part of the map.

## 5. Export the Route as a KMZ File
- In the map’s legend on the left, click on the three-dot menu icon next to the map’s title.
- Select **"Export to KML/KMZ"**.
- In the export options, choose **"Export as KMZ"**.
- You may have the option to export only the "Directions" layer. Select it if available, to download just the route.
- Click **"Download"** to save the KMZ file to your device.

## 6. Use the KMZ File
- Your route is now saved as a KMZ file on your device. You can open it in GPS software that supports KMZ or [convert it to GPX](https://eseev-german.github.io/kmz_gpx/index.html).

## Notes
- Google My Maps allows you to create and customize maps with routes, waypoints, and other elements. The KMZ file is a compressed version of KML, containing all map data.
